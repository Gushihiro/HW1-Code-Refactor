# HW1-Code-Refactor
<!--HW required us to push the HW folder provided to us from gitlabs onto our own GitHub repository using git bash. From there we had to ensure the index.html was in the root folder so the web page would properly display from GitHub. -->

<!--Changed divs to be more specific to what content they contained. Adjusted the stylesheet accordingly. Changed some classes and completely removed any div tags from the index. Consolidated the css to remove unnecessarily dense descriptions.>
